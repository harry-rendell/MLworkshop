    "We are going to build and train a simple neural network to classify the MNIST dataset. This dataset contains 1,796 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The images are an 8x8 grid of pixel values. Although this is an easy task for a human, it's not so easy for a computer. Since every image in the database is unique, we need a model which can adapt to different handwriting styles and classify them accurately. This is where machine learning comes in!"
